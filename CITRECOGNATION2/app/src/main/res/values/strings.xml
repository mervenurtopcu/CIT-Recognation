    <string name="info_1">CIT Recognation application consists of two parts. In the first part, letters and numbers are predicted by drawing by hand over the machine learning model created using artificial intelligence.
        In the second part, text determination is made by taking a photo or choosing a photo from the gallery.
        The text on the selected image is detected and the text on the image is converted to text format.</string>
    <string name="info_2">Artificial intelligence was used in the first part of the application.
        For the application, the network was trained and a model was created with Deep Learning and
        CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) using the Balanced dataset in the EMNIST Dataset.</string>
